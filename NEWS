MINOR FEATURES

IMPROVEMENTS

* `readability_word_stats` and `readability_word_stats_by` used **stringi**'s
  sentence detection.  This was not accurate as seen:
  http://stackoverflow.com/q/31865511/1000343.  The package now utilizes the
  following regex with **stringi**:
  `"(?<!\\w\\.\\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z]\\.)(?<=\\.|\\?|\\!)\\s"`

CHANGES

syllable 0.0.1

polysyllables.  The tools rely primarily on a 'data.table' hash table lookup,
resulting in fast syllable counting.
